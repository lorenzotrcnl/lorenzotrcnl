  <h2> Ingegneria del Calcio </h2>

  <p> Deployed as a preview in the early stage of the 2019/2020 season, it has been positively received by the technical department of the 20 Lega Serie A clubs. Let's take a look together at the features and mission of an all-Italian software that proposes to fit into the technical-tactical context of the match.

  <p> Data collection from football matches has been an established reality for years. From training to competition, athletes are subjected to continuous monitoring of physical, technical and tactical parameters. Over the past decade, techniques and types of data acquired intra and post-match have followed and evolved, which we can divide into three categories: gps data, event data (or soccer logs), and position data (or video-tracking data). But it is the latter two that dominate the "football data analysis" scene, representing the main resource for the development of advanced mathematical models, algorithms and statistics.

  <h2> Kaggle </h2>
  
  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lorenzotarcinale/tiktokvideo-homework"> TikTok Videos - Homework </a>
  <p> This notebook is the realization of a homework assigned to me in college. The goal is to extract some analytics by formulating a series of queries based on the data contained within this dataset. The project involves the use of three different tools to answer the same analytics: MongoDB, Neo4j and Apache Spark. In this notebook I will implement the results obtained using Apache Spark.

  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/lorenzotarcinale/beijing-pm2-5-eda-and-predictions"> Beijing PM2.5: EDA and Predictions </a>
  <p> The subject of the report is the analysis of the Beijing PM2.5 dataset, a multivariate time series focusing on the amount of fine particulate matter in the air in the city of Beijing. We will proceed in two ways: initially we will focus on the dataset in the univariate sense, analyzing and visualizing with appropriate tools only one variable in the dataset (PM2.5); after that we will look at the dataset in the multivariate sense, analyzing the possible correlation between the variables in the dataset and estimating a predictive model for the amount of PM2.5 in the air.

  <h2> Miscellaneous </h2>
  
  <a href="https://github.com/lorenzotrcnl/lorenzotrcnl/blob/main/bachelor_thesis.pdf"> Bachelor Thesis </a>
  <p> The use of algorithms, in football, is gradually increasing not only to evaluate and measure the performance of their players, both in training and during official matches, but also to carry out economic-financial evaluations of the teams themselves, evaluations that are useful for better understanding the market in which they compete. The main objective of this work is precisely to extend a data analysis logic used in professional football to a youth football team.
